# Average Reads Data Analysis

## Planning

### Hypothesis
> If the average rating for a book is higher than average, the user’s rating will also be higher than average.
* Approved by prof
* Needs fleshing out
* Define: higher than average
  * Average of all ratings compared with average of user ratings?

### Raw Data Needed
- All ratings of all books
  - `SELECT * FROM ratings`
- Query all data from server and store in a file
  - Only needs to be queried once

### Processing Data
- Average rating of a book by all users
- Average of each user’s ratings
- Stores in program every time it's ran

### Displaying Data
- Using Python to create interpolated graphs?
  - `scipy`, `matplotlib`
- Outputs to PNGs to put on poster
